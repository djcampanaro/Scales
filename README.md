# Scales

This python project allows a user to enter musical notes, and then determines the corresponding scale.


## How to run

This project was created using PyCharm. In order to use it on another IDE, 
you will need to install the necessary Python extensions. This includes tkinter as the GUI.

Once the program is installed and run, 
the user can enter the notes of a scale in order separated by commas and/or spaces. As the notes are typed in, 
the list of possible scales that are displayed will reduce until they are left with the scale that fits the given notes.
