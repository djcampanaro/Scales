# ScaleFinder

This python project allows a user to enter musical notes in order, and then determines the corresponding scale.

Once the program is installed and run, 
the user can enter the notes of a scale in order separated by commas and/or spaces. As the notes are typed in, 
the list of possible scales that are displayed will reduce until they are left with the scale that fits the given notes.

## Requirements


This project was created using PyCharm. It can be opened in other IDEs that run Python, but you must ensure that Python has been installed on your device.

Tkinter is a GUI library that is built into Python.

### How to run

Open up main.py in your IDE of choice, and run the code to bring up the Tkinter GUI.
